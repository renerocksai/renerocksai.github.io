This is my first post, a placeholder for more to come. My opinions are strong, and this page is their outlet.


I am slowly building this site, will flesh out the projects section soon - and start blogging. Most likely on the [RRISC CPU](/projects/rrisc), I gave a talk about yesterday.

Other areas of interest that need addressing:
- What's wrong with the software industry?
- How to produce statically linked, standalone executables of GUI software for all major platforms?
- How to share self-written software and how Apple and Microsoft are making that increasingly harder.
