I am a software engineer, programmer, researcher with a strong background in
computer science and electronics. My areas of interest are manifold but tend to
center around science and technology.

I enjoy digital electronics, e.g. building a [RRISC CPU](/projects/rrisc/),
as well as hacking on deep learning models [that detect logos on the
go](/projects/brille/) or creating native mobile apps, server software, or
even web apps. Sometimes, I just [take a game engine and turn it into a
multiplayer slide show](/projects/bullets/). Oh, and did I mention
blockchains?

I am fascinated by creating pieces of enabling technology. Be it free and open
software as a means of democratization or software that enables research
otherwise not possible. With a purpose attached, things become meaningful.

You would typically find me with a maximized Linux console window filling my
screen, tiled using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), hacking on code
in [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and saving the world on the commandline in the
other panes. It's just so productive if you don't have to reach for the mouse.

That said, I am also a fan of [Chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/)
- as they are super secure, super fast, and also give you a Linux shell for the
  non GUI part of the day. Not to be misleading, Linux GUI apps work on
  Chromebooks, too, of course.

On my 2015 Pixelbook, I developed a [CPU](/projects/rrisc/) from scratch, a
[networked presentation software](/projects/bullets/) using the
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) apps
for Android (native) and web, etc. It has completely replaced my 2016 MacBook
Pro with a broken keyboard and useless touch bar.

My professional background spans over more than two decades in the
telecommunications, medical technology, market research, and artificial
intelligence industries - current stop: [ZML](https://zml.ai).
