# What Changed -- should go into its own post / text

# You shouldn't use zap

# You might still want to use zap


# Why zap.Endpoints?

- Reusable Building Blocks

Since Endpoints are self-contained structs, they can be re-used easily: either in the same project on different slugs, or even in  a different project (with different "App").

- use zig's std.fs.path to split the path -> get /users/id with optional id

# fix those sh.tty URLPARAM FreeMeOrNot thigs


# the new zap.App API

have to stop writing, wanna focus on blobz
