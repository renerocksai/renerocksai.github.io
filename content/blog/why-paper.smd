_In a world of productivity apps, task managers, and digital distractions, the humble sheet of paper is still undefeated._

Before you dive into your inbox, scroll through Slack, or check your to-do app,
consider this: what if the most powerful tool to start your day isn’t digital
at all?

It’s just a blank, boring sheet of paper.

## The Power of a Clean Slate

A single sheet of paper is context-free. It’s distraction-proof. It doesn’t
ping or pop up or lure you into yesterday’s chaos. It just sits there, quietly
inviting you to think.

When you start your day, this is exactly what you need: a moment to think
before the digital whirlwind begins.

## A Simple Morning Ritual

Here’s the method:

1.	Grab a clean sheet of paper. Literally. A physical one.
2.	Write down the **three most important tasks** you want to achieve today.
3.	Rank them by importance.
4.	Once that’s done—you may check your devices.

That’s it.

If you only manage to complete Task #1, congratulations—you’ve had a successful
day. Tasks #2 and #3? Bonus points. This tiny ritual gives your day direction,
clarity, and momentum.

## Why Not Just Use a To-Do App?

Because even _getting_ to your to-do app is a minefield.

By the time you’ve unlocked your phone or opened your laptop, you’ve already
encountered a dozen notifications. Messages, pings, news, updates—it’s like
trying to start your day in the middle of a circus.

Paper doesn’t do that to you. It doesn’t show you yesterday’s notes, or
surprise you with a forgotten deadline, or tempt you with a new productivity
feature you absolutely have to try.

It just waits. Silently.

## But What About Fancy Notebooks and Paper Tablets?

Sure, there are digital alternatives that try to replicate
paper: the reMarkable tablet, distraction-free apps, or your
beloved Moleskine. They’re great—until they’re not.

Even a real notebook can trip you up. Flipping past old scribbles can pull you
into old thoughts. And yes—make sure it’s a **left-hand page**. You’d be
surprised how a filled left-hand page can hijack your brain.

And digital paper tablets? No better. They're designed to mimic notebooks after
all. A reMarkable might greet you with yesterday’s messy notes, a half-finished
mind map, or the wrong folder. Your brain wanders. Your intention dissolves.


## It’s Not About Perfection

You won’t do this every day. Neither do I. But even doing it _sometimes_ can
make a huge difference.

This isn’t about rigid productivity hacks. It’s about creating just enough
structure to cut through the noise.

So tomorrow morning, skip the apps. Skip the inbox. Skip the notifications.

And start with a sheet of paper.
