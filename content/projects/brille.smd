Mind you, the year was 2017. I trained a [deep convolutional neural
network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) for brand
logo detection using the darknet deep learning framework (now taken over by
[hank.ai](https://github.com/hank-ai/darknet)), in C.

For deployment of the model, I wrote an Android app that captures images from a
USB webcam and feeds the images to the neural network.

## Making Of

### 1. Get Glasses

### 3. Train, test, and select best model

## Mobile logo detection in the wild

I created a video from everything the glasses "saw" during a stroll through the
city of Nuremberg, Germany, with bounding boxes around all logos from our
dataset.

The bounding boxes are green when the glasses recognized a logo correctly, red
when a logo was detected but got the brand wrong, and white when the glasses
missed a logo.

The ground truths were carefully annotated by our working student.

Here is the start frame of the video, with details of the task.

The results were pretty good:

A small casestudy revealed the following:

Here are a few sample detections:
