I created my own slideshow presentation program. Its most unique feature is that
it supports "multiplayer" presentations. [Why and how I created
it](/blog/why-bullets).

Check it out on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~renerocksai/bullets/) or watch the
[demo presentation](https://renerocksai.github.io/bullets/bullets.html).
