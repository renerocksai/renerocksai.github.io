Are AI Agents the future of Market Research? At [NIM](https://nim.org), I
developed a fully automated prototype agent with a GPT brain that produces
insights and concrete, actionable results from a single query by designing and
running online surveys with real participants, and then analyzing the data,
incl. open-ended survey responses.

There's also a "how it works" at the end of the video below.

This is one of the research projects where I used a [Zap](/projects/zap)
backend, to much success. It featured endpoints for survey creation and
monitoring by the agent, the frontend web app for interfacing with the agent,
and hosted all the surveys conducted by the agent.
