I am a software engineer, programmer, researcher with a strong background in
computer science and electronics. My areas of interest are manifold but tend to
center around science and technology.

I love programming, mostly in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) and
[Python](https://python.org), artificial intelligence, and I might
[blog](/blog) occasionally.

My most well-known open source projects are:
- **⚡ZAP⚡:**
  [blazingly fast backends in zig](https://zigzap.org)
- **Telekasten.nvim:**
  [Note-taking in Neovim](https://github.com/nvim-telekasten/telekasten.nvim)

My professional background spans over more than two decades in the
telecommunications, medical technology, market research, and artificial
intelligence industries.
