I created my own slideshow presentation program. Its most unique feature is that it supports "multiplayer" presentations. [Why and how I created it](/blog/why-bullets).

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/renerocksai/bullets) or watch the [demo presentation](https://renerocksai.github.io/bullets/bullets.html).
